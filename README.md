# BannerWriter.ps1
This powershell script can be used to add a banner (from a text file) to any existing or new powershell script.

There is a few example banners included in the package.

By using a text file for the Banner, we dont need to worry about escaping special characters or extra work like that.

There is a lot of "fluff" in here to add extra fun to the function.  Please modify or take snippets from this script to suit your needs and enjoy.
